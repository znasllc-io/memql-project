# ==================================
#
# The FUNCTIONAL post-deploy gate (znasllc-io/memql#1519) + the bff
# auto-promote step (#1520). The authority that stamps a release VALIDATED --
# augmenting the digest-drift-only signal (drift-check.sh), which today went
# green on a deploy that was actually broken in two silent ways:
#
#   1. The 0.9.60 bff blue/green Rollout (autoPromotionEnabled:false) parked at
#      BlueGreenPause and was never promoted: bff-active's selector stayed on
#      the OLD rollouts-pod-template-hash (a stale color with no agent peer ->
#      `siSuggest: no connected agent node available`). drift-check (digest
#      match) + `kubectl rollout status` BOTH reported the deploy healthy.
#   2. Identity JWKS diverged across replicas (per-pod keys) -> ~50% of token
#      verifications failed. Completely silent.
#
# A digest-only check can see NEITHER. This gate is functional: it promotes the
# bff Rollout, then proves the release is actually serving correctly across
# THREE conditions, failing LOUDLY (non-zero) if any does not hold:
#
#   1. bff promoted    -- `kubectl argo rollouts status bff` == Healthy AND the
#                         bff-active Service selector's rollouts-pod-template-hash
#                         == the Rollout's stable (release) color. Catches the
#                         false-green unpromoted-Rollout case (#1).
#   2. JWKS coherent   -- poll the LB /.well-known/jwks.json N times AND every
#                         identity pod directly; FAIL if the served kid set
#                         diverges across replicas (or across polls). Catches
#                         per-pod-key divergence (#2).
#   3. functional auth -- a real authenticated round-trip that exercises
#                         BFF -> agent forwarding (the in-cluster
#                         class="service_account" deploy-gate query, or an
#                         authed query with MEMQL_SMOKE_TOKEN). Catches
#                         "no connected agent node available".
#
# PROMOTE (#1520). promote_bff() folds the bff blue/green promotion into the
# flow: after the new color is Ready and its prePromotionAnalysis (deploy-gate
# AnalysisRun) is green, it runs `kubectl argo rollouts promote bff` (handling
# the documented "may need promoting twice" case), then asserts bff-active ==
# the release color. If the AnalysisRun FAILED it does NOT promote (the old
# color stays active) and fails LOUDLY -- a failed analysis must never flip
# traffic.
#
# Wired into scripts/deploy/aks-deploy.sh (promote_bff before the health gate;
# run_functional_gate inside health_gate as the validation authority). Also
# runnable standalone for re-validation:  post-deploy-gate.sh --env=staging
#
# Per the repo + global Skills+Scripts convention (CLAUDE.md): function-based,
# one responsibility per function, main() at the bottom. set -euo pipefail.
# Idempotent + re-runnable: a promote on an already-promoted Rollout is a
# no-op, and the checks are pure reads.

Usage: $0 [options]

The FUNCTIONAL post-deploy gate (#1519) + bff auto-promote (#1520). Promotes
the bff blue/green Rollout, then validates a release across THREE conditions:
bff-promoted, jwks-coherence, and functional-auth (a real BFF->agent
round-trip). A failure on any blocks/flags the release loudly (non-zero exit).

Options:
    --env=ENV         Environment label for log context (staging|production).
                      The target cluster is the current kubectl context.
                      Default: staging.
    --promote-only    Run ONLY the bff promote step (#1520); skip the gate.
    --gate-only       Run ONLY the 3-condition gate (#1519); skip the promote.
    --no-promote      Run the gate but do not promote the bff Rollout (assumes
                      it is already promoted / auto-promotion is on).
    --dry-run         Print the plan and mutate nothing (no cluster writes).
    --help            Show this help.

The three gate conditions (#1519):
    1. bff promoted    rollout status Healthy AND $ACTIVE_SERVICE selector hash
                       == the Rollout's release (stable) color.
    2. JWKS coherent   the kid set served by the LB /.well-known/jwks.json and
                       by every identity pod is IDENTICAL across replicas.
    3. functional auth an authenticated BFF->agent round-trip succeeds (the
                       in-cluster service_account deploy-gate query, or an
                       authed query via MEMQL_SMOKE_TOKEN).

Env knobs: APP_HOST, IDENTITY_HOST, JWKS_POLLS ($JWKS_POLLS), DEPLOY_GATE_IMAGE,
DEPLOY_GATE_JWT_SECRET ($DEPLOY_GATE_JWT_SECRET), MEMQL_SMOKE_TOKEN.

Examples:
    $0 --env=staging            # promote bff, then run the full gate
    $0 --gate-only              # validate an already-promoted release
    $0 --promote-only           # just promote the bff Rollout (#1520)

#   1. The in-cluster class="service_account" deploy-gate (the #691 machine
#      identity). Used when the deploy-gate-jwt Secret + deploy-gate image are
#      present -- the operator/CI path that needs no interactive login. This is
#      the canonical, re-runnable probe.
#   2. An authed query with MEMQL_SMOKE_TOKEN (a PAT/JWT) via the deep smoke
#      profile, when a token is provided but no in-cluster gate is wired.
#   3. DEGRADE GRACEFULLY (documented): with NEITHER, the round-trip cannot run
#      headlessly. We do NOT silently pass -- we FAIL by default so the gate is
#      conclusive, unless --no-promote / explicit GATE_FUNCTIONAL_OPTIONAL=1
#      downgrades it to a loud WARNING for an operator running a manual login
#      round-trip out of band.
