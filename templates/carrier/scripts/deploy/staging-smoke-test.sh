# ====================================
#
# Repeatable end-to-end smoke test for the live staging cluster
# (znasllc-io/memql#535). Exercises the real product path through the
# public HTTPS front door rather than just pod health:
#
#   1. TLS + DNS      -- every public host resolves and serves a valid,
#                        browser-trusted (Let's Encrypt) certificate.
#   2. Identity       -- /healthz is green and the JWKS document is
#                        published + well-formed, BOTH directly on the
#                        identity host AND through the app's same-origin
#                        /.well-known/jwks.json proxy (proves the
#                        app-identity-proxy Ingress route).
#   3. Auth surface   -- the magic-link login page is served (the magic-
#                        link issue + JWT-verify round trip is an opt-in
#                        DEEP check; see SMOKE_EMAIL / MEMQL_SMOKE_TOKEN).
#   4. BFF query      -- the /memql/ws WebSocket endpoint accepts an
#                        upgrade (and, with a token + ws client, runs a
#                        real authenticated query through the BFF).
#   5. AI forward     -- a real query that fans BFF -> cognition/agent and
#                        returns a complete response (DEEP, needs a token).
#   6. Voice path     -- the /memql/audio WS route is reachable over https
#                        (secure context) -- the voice node's STT entry.
#
# Read-only by default: the baseline checks send no email and mutate
# nothing. The DEEP checks (full magic-link flow, authenticated query,
# AI forward) only run when their inputs are supplied, and every skipped
# check is reported explicitly -- a SKIP is never silently a PASS.
#
# Per the repo Skills+Scripts convention (CLAUDE.md): function-based,
# one responsibility per function, main() at the bottom. set -uo pipefail
# WITHOUT -e -- this is a status reporter; an individual failing check
# must not abort the remaining checks. Exit code is non-zero iff any
# check FAILED (skips do not fail the run).

Usage: $0 [--help]

Repeatable end-to-end smoke test against the live staging cluster.

Environment overrides:
    APP_HOST            Public app host       (default: app.staging.__DOMAIN__)
    IDENTITY_HOST       Public identity host  (default: identity.staging.__DOMAIN__)
    CURL_TIMEOUT        Per-request seconds   (default: 15)
    SMOKE_PROFILE       baseline | deep       (default: baseline)
                        deep = the promotion gate: every deep check MUST run and
                        PASS; a missing input (no token / ws client) is a FAIL,
                        not a SKIP. A deep run with no MEMQL_SMOKE_TOKEN fails.
    SMOKE_EMAIL         Send a real magic link to this address (opt-in, non-gating)
    MEMQL_SMOKE_TOKEN   PAT/JWT to run the authenticated WS query + AI forward
                        (required in the deep profile)

Checks:
    baseline: TLS+DNS, identity health+JWKS (direct + app proxy), login page,
              /memql/ws + /memql/audio wiring, SPA boot assets, identity styling.
    deep:     all baseline checks PLUS a real authenticated WS query that fans
              BFF -> cognition/agent (catches the issuer/mesh/auth-WS class that
              front-door-green hid in the 0.9.6 incident), PLUS a node-bootstrap
              transport probe asserting plaintext /node/bootstrap never mints a
              token over cleartext (the #626 https-end-to-end invariant).

Not yet asserted here (tracked #627 follow-ups -- they need infra beyond the
front door): automation_execution_claims table presence (needs a server-side
readiness endpoint -- DB is firewalled to AKS egress) and the headless-browser
first-run walkthrough + console-error capture (needs a browser in CI).

Examples:
    $0                                                  # baseline (no auth)
    SMOKE_PROFILE=deep MEMQL_SMOKE_TOKEN=mql_pat_xxx $0 # the promotion gate
    APP_HOST=app.__DOMAIN__ SMOKE_PROFILE=deep MEMQL_SMOKE_TOKEN=... $0  # prod

Exit code is non-zero iff a check FAILED. In baseline a SKIP never fails the
run; in deep a missing required input is a FAIL.
